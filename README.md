# Projects
Hackathons and Personal Projects - HandsOn

This repository contains files that provides information on projects i have worked on/ working on. I have used python as primary programming language to build the project code. I generally prefer working on Jupyter Notebook if i am working on a project on my own or Google Colab if its a team project.

The primary modules that i have used in the implemented projects contain importing of modules like Pandas, Pandas-Profiling, Numpy, Scipy, Sklearn, DateTime, Pycaret etc. Some of the functionalities i implemented may contain importing of several other modules in python.
