# Projects
Hackathons and Personal Projects - HandsOn

This repository contains files that provides information on projects i have worked on or in progress. I have used python as a primary programming language to build the project code. I generally prefer working on Jupyter Notebook or Pycharm if i am working on my local environment or Google Colab if its a team project.

The primary modules that i have used in the implemented projects contain importing of modules like Pandas, Pandas-Profiling, Numpy, Scipy, Sklearn, OS, DateTime, Pycaret, TensorFlow, Keras, Streamlit etc. Some of the files may contain importing of several other modules in python, which are required for certain use cases.
